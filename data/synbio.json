{"technical_approach": "The technical approach to achieve the two task areas of the Syn Bio Project are discussed separately below: BioNutrients Technical Approach: The overall scope of the BioNutrients efforts is comprised of several sub-tasks as outlined below. Aim1: Conduct ISS Flight Test of BioNutrients-1 The work contained in this Aim involves the development and testing of a platform technology that demonstrates in situ microbial production of targeted nutrients to address food and supplement storage challenges in long duration missions. The process utilizes individual production packs that enclose a dried, edible, extended shelf-life growth substrate and the common food microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces boulardi - both yeasts, that have been genetically engineered to produce zeaxanthin and beta-carotene respectively. Upon crew-conducted hydration and mixing of the growth packet contents, the organism activates and rapidly produces a desired amount of biomass and the target nutrient. The food/beverage hydration stations already employed in spacecraft will be used to supply the water for packet hydration. The amount of the nutrient is controlled by the eventual limitation of the growth media, leading to consistent levels of biomass and thereby the nutrient it contains. In future implementation, once growth is completed the contents of the package will be heat-deactivated to kill the food microorganisms while maintaining nutrient quality, and then consumed by the crew. The system would employ a single-species inoculum with a sterile, single-use packet growth system, thereby ensuring a safe and simple food production environment. The overall strategy consists of identifying a safe food organism that will be genetically engineered to produce a mission-relevant nutrient. The organisms must also be able to be reliably stored for very long durations (multiple years), so the dormant form of the organism (spores) is likely the optimal storage format. An edible media must be used as this will be consumed by the crew along with the grown organisms, similar to how milk transformed by bacteria becomes yogurt. These components will be contained in a custom-developed storage packet, which will also serve as the growth vessel. The packet is a single-use system that would nominally be disposed of after use, similar to how space food / beverage bags are discarded. It contains features to manage the microbially-produced CO2, while keeping the water and microorganisms safely contained in the growth packet. The system is planned to be tested over a 5-year period on the ISS and ground controls. This involves having the prepared growth packets containing dried edible media and yeast spores contained in an outer storage bag that protects it from water and oxygen exposure. Sufficient numbers of these bags will be brought to ISS to allow a test to be conducted by the crew intermittently over a 5-year period. It is anticipated to conduct 6 hydration tests (4 replicates/test) over the five years. This will allow evaluation of overall performance in a timeframe that matches desired food shelf-life duration for future Mars surface missions. A test will consist of a crew member removing 4 storage bags and removing the inner growth packet from the outer storage bag. Each growth packet will be hydrated using 33 ml of sterile water, the contents well mixed, and then placed within a temperature controlled incubator at 30oC for 48 hours. The growth packets will then be removed and placed in a -80oC freezer and maintained at that temperature until returned to the ground-based laboratory for evaluation. In addition to these treatments, other samples will be tested during this 5-year test. They will include similar storage/growth packet systems that are not hydrated in space, but rather just stored and returned to Earth to allow more detailed observations when activated in the laboratory. Similarly, various wild-type (non-engineered) and engineered food microbes (including probiotic organisms) will be stored in sealed vials and intermittently returned to Earth for evaluation (a total of 14 stasis pack return events are planned). Ground evaluation of growth packets activated in space will undergo tests including; total yeast biomass present, zeaxanthin production, microbial contamination detection, and multiple “omics” analyses. Returned un-activated production packs and stasis pack microbes will undergo activation in the laboratory and then subjected to similar tests as noted above, as well as growth rate evaluation and stasis efficacy. Payload Concept of Operations. The following points are criteria that influence the BioNutrients-1 experiment schedule: The science team requires sample returns for different sample types distributed over a 5-year period in order to obtain time-dependent data. For highest-quality comparison results, there is a need to execute the on-orbit experiment (ISS Production Packs) as closely as possible to returned controls (Earth Production Packs). An incubator (Space Automated Bioproduct Lab, SABL or comparable) must be available for ISS Production Pack experiment execution. Cold Stowage volume must be available for stowage and return of ISS Production Packs at the required temperature range (between -70°C and -100°C). 8 packs fit into ½ Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) box. Figure 2 summarizes the current BioNutrients-1 Experiment Schedule. Due to unknown future flight scheduling and the various dependencies listed above, the experiment schedule is notional and may need to be re-negotiated over-time. An updated figure with as run schedule and refined future flight scheduling will be provided with each yearly report. As depicted in Figure 2, it is desirable to return Earth Production Pack Kits to the PI’s lab for experiment execution and then execute the corresponding ISS Production Pack experiments on-orbit such that Earth and ISS Pack execution occurs at approximately the same time. As a result, ISS Production Pack experiments will occur after SpX unberth. The desired timeframe for incubation is U+7 to 9d (±4d), which allows for adequate time for the PD to deliver the recently-descended Earth Production Packs to the PI’s lab. "}
